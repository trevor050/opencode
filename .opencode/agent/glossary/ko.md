# ko Glossary

## Sources

- PR #9817: https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/9817

## Do Not Translate (Locale Additions)

- `OpenCode` (preserve casing in prose; keep `opencode` only in commands, package names, paths, or code)
- `OpenCode CLI`
- `CLI`, `TUI`, `MCP`, `OAuth`
- Commands, flags, file paths, and code literals (keep exactly as written)

## Preferred Terms

No PR-backed term mappings yet. Add entries here when review PRs introduce repeated wording corrections.

## Guidance

- Prefer natural Korean phrasing over literal translation
- Keep tone clear and direct in UI labels and docs prose
- Preserve technical artifacts exactly: commands, flags, code, URLs, model IDs, and file paths

## Avoid

- Avoid translating product and protocol names that are fixed identifiers
- Avoid mixing multiple Korean terms for the same recurring UI action once a preferred term is established
