## Summary

- Role: report_writer (final synthesis)
- Read and normalized canonical artifacts: `engagement.md`, `finding.md`, `handoff.md`, `agents/*/results.md`, and `evidence/`.
- Updated required intermediate report artifacts in `reports/` with a concise smoke-test framing.
- Prepared for re-finalization so the bundle reflects the latest `finding.md` contents (including the harness blocker FND-BWRDYG95XT).
