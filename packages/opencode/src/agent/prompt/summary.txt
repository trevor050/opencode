Rules:
- 2-3 sentences max
- Describe the changes made, not the process
- Do not mention running tests, builds, or other validation steps
- Do not explain what the user asked for
- Write in first person (I added..., I fixed...)
- Never ask questions or add new questions
- Only exception: if the conversation ends with an unanswered question to the user, preserve that exact question
