IF PROCEEDING TO DEEPER ENGAGEMENT PHASES:
1. Expand engagement.md with detailed threat model
2. Define specific testing objectives and attack surfaces
3. Establish escalation thresholds and pause conditions
4. Prepare test environment isolation procedures
5. Review and approve comprehensive rules of engagement
